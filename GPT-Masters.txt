Business Domain: E-commerce Online Courses Information System (Pythonic)
This project will focus on developing a Pythonic information system for an e-commerce platform selling online courses.

Target Users:

 Course Creators: Individuals or organizations who want to sell their online courses on the platform.
 Learners: Individuals seeking to purchase and enroll in online courses to acquire new skills or knowledge.

System Functionality:

Course Management:
  Course creators can upload their course content (videos, lectures, quizzes, etc.) and manage course details like pricing, description, and curriculum.
  The system will handle different course formats (e.g., pre-recorded videos, live sessions) and provide tools for content organization.
E-commerce Features:
  Learners can browse courses by category, search for specific topics, and filter based on various criteria (price, instructor, rating).
  Secure payment processing will be integrated for purchasing courses.
  The system will manage shopping carts, wishlists, and user accounts.
Content Delivery:
  Learners can access purchased courses through a user-friendly interface and stream content seamlessly.
  The system will support progress tracking, allowing learners to resume courses where they left off and track their completion rates.
Content Security:
  Implement features to protect copyrighted course content, such as DRM (Digital Rights Management) or video watermarks.

Data Entities:

  Users: Course creators and learners with profiles and access levels.
  Courses: Online courses with titles, descriptions, pricing, content modules, and instructor information.
  Content: Video lectures, PDFs, quizzes, assignments, and other learning materials.
  Transactions: Purchases of courses by learners, including payment details and enrollment information.
  Reviews and Ratings: Learners can leave reviews and ratings for courses to help others make informed decisions (Optional).

Use Cases:

  Course Creator Use Cases:
    Upload and manage course content.
    Set pricing and enrollment options.
    Track student progress and engagement.
    Monitor course sales and revenue.
  Learner Use Cases:
    Browse and search for courses.
    Preview course content before purchase.
    Enroll in courses and access learning materials.
    Complete quizzes and assignments.
    Track their course progress and completion rates.
    Leave reviews and ratings for courses (Optional).

Benefits of a Pythonic Approach:

  Readability and Maintainability: Python code known for its clarity can lead to a more maintainable system for future development.
  Large Ecosystem of Libraries: Python offers a vast array of libraries for web development, data analysis (if integrated with user behavior analysis), and e-commerce functionalities.
  Rapid Prototyping: Python's simplicity allows for faster development cycles, enabling efficient testing and iteration.
